# Alzheimer-s-Prediction  

## Predicting Alzheimer's disease progression trajectory and clinical subtypes using machine learning  

Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is a common, age-related, neurodegenerative disease that impairs a person's ability to perform day-to-day activities. Diagnosing AD is challenging, especially in the early stages. Many patients remain undiagnosed, partly due to the complex heterogeneity in disease progression. This diagnostic challenge highlights a need for early prediction of the disease course to assist its treatment and tailor management to the disease progression rate. Recent developments in machine learning techniques provide the potential to predict disease progression and trajectory of AD and classify the disease into different etiological subtypes.  

## Conclusion  
The machine learning techniques presented in this study may assist providers with identifying different progression rates and trajectories in the early stages of disease progression, hence allowing for more efficient and unique care deliveries.
